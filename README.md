# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects by Sudershan 

Welcome to the official repository of two insightful EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) projects:

1. **Google Play Store EDA** – Dive deep into the Android app ecosystem.
2. **Student Performance EDA** – Uncover patterns in academic success and influencing factors.

These projects aim to explore, visualize, and derive meaningful insights using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
